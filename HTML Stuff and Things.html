	<h1>A Condensed Guide to HTML5 -- Written in HTML5</h1>
		<p>The only thing you will need to get started is the Notepad application on your desktop!</p>
		<p>To start coding in HTML, you will need to first write your basic tags.  These are as follows:</p>
			<p> <img src="BaseTags.png" alt="Code Image"> </p>
	
				<br>
			<p>&lt;br&gt; tags create line breaks</p>
			<p>&lt;!-- "comments" --&gt; tags create comments only visible within the code</p>
				<br>
	
			<p>For now we will only focus on basic HTML coding and will not be stylizing the page.  I will do another web page for Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
	
	<div>
		<h2>Table of Contints</h2>
			<p>Below I have created a list using tags that we will go over in the following sections.  I wish to emphasise that this is a table of contents, and in order to make said table, we will need to use &lt;a href="#name"&gt; as shown below.</p>
				<p> <img src="TableOfContents.png" alt="Code Image"></p>
			<p>In order to link the code shown above to places located on the page, you will need to use &lt;a name=""&gt; as shown below.</p>
	</div>	
		<nav>
			<ul>
				<li> <a href="#Lists">Lists Section</a></li>
				<li> <a href="#Tables">Tables Section</a></li>
				<li> <a href="#Web Links">Web Links Section</a></li>
				<li> <a href="#Images">Images Section</a></li>
				<li> <a href="#Boxes">Text and Number Boxes Section</a></li>
				<li> <a href="#Buttons">Radio Buttons and Checkboxes Section</a></li>
				<li> <a href="#Elements">Elements and Characters Section</a></li>
			</ul>
		</nav>

	<h3> <a name="Lists"></a>Lists</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>&lt;ul&gt; tags are unordered, or bullet points, always followed by the &lt;li&gt; tag for the list items.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<ol>
			<li>&lt;ol&gt; tags are ordered, or numbered lists, always followed by the &lt;li&gt; tag for the list items.</li>
		</ol>

		<hr>
	
	<h3><a name="Tables"></a>Tables</h3>
		<table>
			<p>The table below pertains to the tags and their effects on a table.</p>
			<tr>
			<!-- <tr> creates rows within tables -->
				<th>&lt;tr&gt;</th>
				<th>&lt;th&gt;</th>
				<th>&lt;td&gt;</th>
				<!-- <th> creates collums within tables -->
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>Rows</td>
				<td>Collums</td>
				<td>Data</td>
				<!-- <td> creates data within tables -->
			</tr>
	
		</table>
		
		<hr>

	<h3><a name="Web Links"></a>Web Links</h3>
		<p>The link below is made by using the &lt;a href=""&gt; tag</p>
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> &lt;a href="www.youtube.com"&gt;</a>
		
		<hr>

	<h3><a name="Images"></a>Images</h3>
		<p> <img src="Sample Image.PNG" width="420" height="250" title="How to Overthrow the Government, By: Justin Poplin" alt="Sample Image"> </p>
		<p>The image above is a sample image, a thumbnail from a powerpoint presentation I presented for my Com 180 Class.</p>
		<p>&lt;img src="Sample Image.PNG" width="420" height="250"&gt; is the code required to imput an image and resize to desire peramiters.</p>
			<p>Notice how if you hover over the image, a caption pops up.  This is achieved by following the following code with title="".  By adding this within the syntax, you add a caption, or title to the image when the user hovers over it.</p>
		<p> <img src="noimage.PNG" alt="Sample alt Text"></p>
			<p>Notice how above there is a little symbol followed by the text, "Sample alt Text"?  This was achieved by following an image source tag with the "alt="" tag.  By adding an alt tag to your images, you can provide context to what wast supposed to appear there if the image fails to load.</p>

		<hr>

	<h3><a name="Boxes"></a>Text and Number Boxes</h3>
		<form action="" method="">
		<!-- Form elements must include input elements -->
			<!-- Input elements go in here -->
			<input type="text" name="">
			<!--  "type =text" means it will be a one line text box -->
			<p>The box above is known as a Control</p>
				<br>
			<input type="text" name="" size="25">
			<!-- the before mentioned code followed by "size=" will resize the text box. -->
			<p>The boxes are commonly refered to as "one line text boxes"</p>
			
			
			<label for="label1">Label 1:</label>
			<input type="text" id="label1" name="">
			<!-- the "for" attribute must match the "id" attribute -->
				<p>The code for these boxes are nested within the &lt;form action="" method=""&gt; tags</p>
				<p>The boxes themselves are "input type="text" name=""</p>
				<p>Labeling said boxes is as simple as proceeding the "input" code with the &lt;label for=""&gt; code</p>
			
			Labeling these boxes requires no tags! <br>
			<textarea row="10" cols="40"></textarea>
			<!-- unlike <input>, <textarea> needs a closing tag. row= and cols=	are the resizing function for the text box -->
				<p>Instead of using the "input" tag, we will use the &lt;textarea&gt; tag to create a resizeable text box.</p>
			<input type="submit" value="Submit">
				<p>Instead of using the "type="text"" value within the input tag, we will use "type="submit" value="submit"" in order to create a submit button.</p>
			
			<input type="number">
			<p>Replacing the type="text" attribute with the type="number" attribute, we can successfully create a number box.</p>
			<p>To impliment a range, you will use the min and max attributes within the code as demonstrated below.</p>
			<input type="number" min="0" max="50">
			<p>I have set the range to include the minimum value of 0 and the maximum value of 50.</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>The follow drop down boxes are added by using the &lt;select&gt; tag followed by the "&lt;option value=""&gt; tag.</p>
			<p>You can have as many option tags as you desire!</p>
			<select>
			
				<option value="Option1">Option 1</option>
				<option value="Option2">Option 2</option>
				<option value="Option3">Option 3</option>
			
			</select>
			
			
	</form>
	
		<hr>
	
	<h3><a name="Buttons"></a>Radio Buttons and Check Boxes</h3>
			<p>Radio Buttons are the small circular buttons on webpages, which allow users to select only one option.  They are commonly used in surveys.</p>
			<p>Radio Buttons are also nested within the &lt;form action="" method=""&gt; tag, and make use of the "imput type=" tag as seen in the previous section.</p>
			<p>To create a Radio Button, you will simply use the "input type="radio" name="" tag</p>
		<form action="" method="">
				Yes:
				<input type="radio" name="yesornot" value=""> <br>
				No:
				<input type="radio" name="yesornot" value=""> <br>
			
			<p>Checkboxes are very similar to Radio Buttons, exept they are used when allowing users to select multiple items.</p>
			<p>To create a checkbox, you will simply use the "input type="checkbox" name="" tag</p>
			<p>To automatically check a box, you will use follow the perseeding code with "checked="checked"" as I have done for Option 1.  This box will automatically be checked when the page loads, but can still be unchecked by the user.</p>
				<input type="checkbox" name="" checked="checked"> Option 1 <br>
				<input type="checkbox" name=""> Option 2 <br>
				<input type="checkbox" name=""> Option 3 <br>
				<input type="checkbox" name=""> Option 4 <br>
			
			<p>The following box allows you to select a date.  This can be achieved by changing the "input type="" tag as follows: &lt;input type="date" name=""&gt;</p>
				Enter Date:
				<input type="date" name="day">
					<br>
				Number of days: 
				<input type="number" name="numdays" min="1" max="10">
					<p>The above code uses the "number min max" tags that we learned about earlier to set a range of available days.</p>
			
			<br>
			
		  <fieldset>
				<legend>Enter Date:</legend>
				<input type="date" name="day">
					<br>
				Number of days: 
				<input type="number" name="numdays" min="1" max="10">
			</fieldset>
			
		  <p>Notice the neat box around the form? this was addes by nesting out previous code in the &lt;fieldset&gt; tag!  The caption "Enter Date:" has also been molded into the box, this was done by including the legend tag around that particular text.</p>
			<p>Our code now looks something like this:</p>
			<p> <image src="CodeEX1.png"></image></p>
	</form>
	
		<hr>
	
	<h3><a name="Elements"></a>Elements and Characters</h3>
		<p>Elements are lines of code that are not visible to the user.</p>
		<h4>Meta Elements</h4>
			<p>Meta Elements tell the search engine what to look for.</p>
	
		<h4>Escape Characters</h4>
			<p>Escape characters are lines of code which translate to a specific character.  A list of basic escape characters is shown below.</p>
				<p> <image src="EscapeChr.png"></image></p>
			<p>A person would need to use these characters due to the fact that HTML reads them as important parts of a code.  The greater and less than signs for example are how a person opens and closes syntaxes, and without the escape characters, the programmer has no way of writing those characters to be visible on the webpage.</p>
	
		<h4>Font Styles</h4>
			<p>To write <b>bold</b> text, you will use the &lt;b&gt; tags.</p>
			<p>A programmer may choose to instead write <strong>bold</strong> text with the &lt;strong&gt; tags.  The difference being that the &lt;strong&gt; tag allows text to speech to add emphisis to words, where the &lt;b&gt; tag does not.</p>
		
			<p>To write <i>italic</i> text, you will use the &lt;i&gt; tags.</p>
			<p>A programmer may choose to instead write <em>italic</em> text with the &lt;em&gt; tags.  The difference being that the &lt;em&gt; tag allows text to speech to add emphisis to words, where the &lt;i&gt; tag does not.</p>
	
		<h4>iframes</h4>
			<p>An iframe is basically just an extra HTML document that you can include into  your webpage without loading a new page or refreshing your page.</p>
			
			<iframe frameborder="1" width="200" height="200" src="one.html" name="ouriframe" id="ouriframe"> </iframe>
				<br>
			<a href="two.html" target="ouriframe">Switch to new document</a>
	
		<h4>Super and Sub Script</h4>
			<p>Super Script is used typically when addressing dates, such as August 9th.  By using the Super Script, we can make it appear as follows: August 9<sup>th</sup>.</p>
			<p>Sub Script is used typically when addressing chemical compounds such as H2O, or water.  By using the sub element, we can make it appear as follows: H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
			<p>It is important to note that both Super and Sub Script are commonly used in many forms of mathematics and can be required when dictating power notations, logrithms, or limits.</p>
			<p>Sub element - &lt;sub&gt; <br> Sup element - &lt;sup&gt;</p>
	
		<h4>Audio Element</h4>
			<p>As you may assume, the Audio Element allows a programmer to include audio into a website.  Web browsers accept three standard formats: .mp3, .wav, and .ogg</p>
				<audio controls="audiocontrols">
					<source src="Call Off The Dawgs (old)_01.mp3" />
				</audio>
			<p>In order to have this audio appear, you will need to write the code as follows:</p>
			<p> <img src="CodeEX2.png" alt="Code Image"></p>
			<p>Obviously the &lt;source src=""&gt; tag will include your audio file's name, but I have provided the code from this webiste as an example.</p>
			<p>You can make the audio file play when the webpage is opened by simply following the &lt;audio controls&gt; tag with autoplay, it would look like this: &lt;audio controles autoplay&gt;.  You can also make the audio file loop by tacking on the word loop after audio controls, like this: &lt; audio controles loop&gt;.</p>
	
		<h4>Video Element</h4>
			<p>Just as with the audio elements, the video elements work almost identically, except instead of &lt;audio controls=""&gt;, we will have &lt;video width="" height="" controls&gt;</p>
			<p>The three standard video formats accepted by almost all web browsers are: .mp4, webm, and .ogg</p>
				<video width="640" height="360" controls>
					<source src="Pinching Seth's Nipples.mp4" width="200" height="200"/>
				</video>
